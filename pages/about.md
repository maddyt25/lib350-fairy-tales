## Project Descripton 

Our collection is composed of fairy/folk tale illustrations from stories featuring curse narratives throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, drawing from a variety of different stories, versions, and illustrators. Our collection might be of interest to those conducting humanities research, or who have a curiosity for different fairy tales, how they have appeared historically, and how curse narratives have reflected societal anxieties of the time. Additionally, to people interested in seeing how certain illustratorsâ€™ work has changed over time, or how fairy tale illustration as a genre has developed stylistically (as this can vary based on the story version and its location of origin).
