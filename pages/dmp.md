**Data Management Plan**

**DMP Requirements**

**Project Description**

* **Our collection is composed of fairy/folk tale illustrations from stories featuring curse narratives throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, drawing from a variety of different stories, versions, and illustrators. Our collection might be of interest to those conducting humanities research, or who have a curiosity for different fairy tales, how they have appeared historically, and how curse narratives have reflected societal anxieties of the time. Additionally, to people interested in seeing how certain illustrators’ work has changed over time, or how fairy tale illustration as a genre has developed stylistically (as this can vary based on the story version and its location of origin).**
  
* **Using CollectionBuilder as a template and Google Sheets for our metadata, we’re hosting our collection as a website on GitHub, allowing users to view, search, and categorize our items by illustrator, story, medium, featured fairy tale curse, location, and date.**

**Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Kitty Fields,Maddy Thomas**  
* **We’ve shared responsibilities for managing and entering data throughout our project. We’ve worked both together to find individual objects, document and upload them, and coordinate our work on the aesthetic and technical parts of our website.**

**Anticipated Data**

* **Our data was collected through various archives, libraries, and museum collections, which we used to both find images and relevant information associated with each object (title, year, illustrator, etc.). While some of the fairy tales we focused on were more well-known, we also used the Aarne-Thompson-Uther index to locate more obscure stories to diversify our collection.**  

**Documentation and Metadata**

* **What type of metadata will accompany this data? Where and how can users access this metadata?**  
  * **Hint: Your data dictionary, once completed, is excellent documentation\! Where and how do you plan on provide it to your audience?**

**Storage and Backup** 

* **Describe resources, repositories, and platforms used to preserve your data during the project.**  
  * **Hint: This should include Google Drive, GitHub, and any storage on your personal computers.**

**Data Sharing**

* **How will you share your data? What will you make available?**  
* **Could others want to reuse your data? In what ways?**  
* **Do you plan on archiving your data in an external repository like Zenodo? (This is not a requirement\!)**

**Period of Data Retention**

* **This section should address how long your group plans to maintain each component of the project before and after it has been submitted for grading.**  
* **If you plan to maintain the project after the term ends, what is your contingency plan if a component of the project goes down?**

**Licensing and Ethical Issues**

* **Use this section to outline the intellectual property rights of your created material.  What are the terms under which others may use these materials? If your data and products raise any potential ethics issues, use this section to address those matters.**
