# LIB 350M — Spring Term Project
## Fairy Tales: Countless Curses
### Course Description
This course provides students with theoretical and practical experience in collecting, processing, archiving, and publishing humanities data (images, video, sound, text, maps, etc.) gathered from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs).

### Project Description
Our collection is composed of fairy/folk tale illustrations from stories featuring curse narratives throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, drawing from a variety of different stories, story versions, and illustrators. It may be of interest to those conducting humanities research, or who have a curiosity for different fairy tales, how they have appeared historically, and how curse narratives have reflected societal anxieties of the time. Additionally, because our collection reflects illustration from a wide range of years, it may be of interest to those wanting to see how certain illustrators’ work has changed over time, or how fairy tale illustration as a genre has developed stylistically (as this can vary based on the story version and its location of origin).

### Data Management Plan
Our data management plan can be accessed through a page on our website (linked [here](https://maddyt25.github.io/lib350-fairy-tales/dmp.html)). In our DMP, we outline our individual responsibilities, and describe an overview of how our data is managed and used to create our collection. 
Our data consists of both JPEG and PNG images, and our collection will be maintained until September 2025, when our new school term starts — although we will leave the website up for viewing even after we stop actively maintaining it. Additionally, our data is backed up on our personal computers, through Microsoft OneDrive, and through a Google Drive folder.
